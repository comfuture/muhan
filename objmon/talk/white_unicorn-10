hello
Not to be rude, but you people really don't belong up here.
up
Yes, up!  If you're not careful, you'll fall through the clouds.
fall
Fall, as in fall back to where you came from.
chanteclaire
I'm sorry, but I do not know her personally, although she does visit often.
visit
On occassion, she has been known to visit with Nathan.
nathan
Nathan is the lord of the unicorns.
lord
The unicorns gladly follow whatever Nathan feels is best.
best
Best for us.  You see, you humans are too brutal for us to communicate with individually.
communicate
Well, we like to see what you people are doing every so often.
doing
Watching you ruin the lands with your dirty cities.
where
Hmm...if you're looking for Nathan, try asking one of the black unicorns.
mondrake
Mondrake is the cloud giant that lives up in the clouds, but I know not where he is.
key
The emerald green key, eh.  Well, I know not where it is, but I do know it has been stolen.
stolen
Yes, stolen.  Someone lifted the key from one of the unicorns who was killed while visiting the surface.
killed
Yes...you people are too barbaric.  Fortunately, the people who took the key probably don't know what it's used for.
barbaric
Down right murderers.  But we don't hold a grudge against your whole society.
society
Your society in general is descent, but there are a few who make things bad.
grudge
We do not trust the people on ships.  The person who killed the unicorn went onto a large ship.
ship
I know not which ship this is.  All I know is that it was docked in your Nylandian Bay.
