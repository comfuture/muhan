hello
Who disturbs me at this time of night?  You're lucky I don't kill you here and now.
disturbs
Can't you see I was sleeping!  Now be gone!
nathan
Why do you speak that name?
name
Nathan, the unicorn lord.  Yes, I know him.
know
He will use any means possible to exterminate me.
exterminate
Yes, exterminate.  I may be old, but I'm still powerful.
old
Who are you calling old?!?
you
Oh, I guess you're right.
powerful
I can still cast a bolt of lightning from fifty yards to fry any humanoid.
lightning
I like lightning.  I even have a scroll for it.
scroll
Yes, mages have been after my scroll for ages.
means
He usually sends mages after me with the promise of a blue scroll if they defeat me.
mages
Damn mages think they can run the world.  Well, not if I can help it.
ages
I do not give away my scrolls.  Do YOU think you can defeat ME?
defeat
Well, you sure do talk a lot.  I can toast your eyeballs from here.  Let's see what you've got.
got
You think you can defeat me?  Others have tried.
tried
Yes, tried and died.
others
Other treasure seeking mages.  Makes me sick.
treasures
If you want treasure, go after Mondrake.  He holds the secret to the thunderbolt scroll.
thunderbolt
A powerful spell I helped make, but Mondrake stole it from me.
stole
I was too weak to destroy him at the time.  If you destroy him, I will be happy.
destroy
Mondrake wouldn't give me credit for working on the scroll with him.  I wish I could have killed him and taken the scroll for myself.
credit
He will deny it of course, but I did some vital research for him.
research
The powerful thunderbolt spell uses elements from MY lightningbolt spell. 
danielle
I know not of that person.
mondrake
Yes, we know this two-faced cloud giant.
two-faced
We worked on the thunderbolt spell together but he refused to give me credit for my work.
giant
Mondrake the cloud giant is a very powerful person.  Even I could not defeat him.
chanteclaire
I know not of that person.
cloud
Mondrake lives high up in the clouds.  Ask Nathan where he is...they're buddies.
buddies
They work together against me.
against
Everyone is out to get me.
