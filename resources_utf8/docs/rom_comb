	How to Create a Combination Lock

Combination locks appear in the game as buttons that must be pushed in a
particular sequence.  Usually they are color-coded, but you can give them
any description you please.  The editor is used to make them as objects.

First, make as many buttons as you desire with each one being a separate
object.  For example, you might make four buttons, black, red, white and blue.
Each button is TYPE 13, and SPECIAL 2.

Now, assume we want the black button to be number zero, (reset) and the
red button to be number one, the white number 2, and the blue one number
three.

A combination of 132 would require the sequence red, blue, white be pushed.
Of course, you can require that a button be pushed more than once if you
want a longer combination..

In the output string for each object, put the combination, preceded by a
zero.  Example:  0132322
The first zero is the reset, and each number is a colored button.

Makes the shots equal to 0/0.

In order to identify the Reset button as different from the others,
make it:
	1d0 Plus 2.

Each of the other buttons are:
	0d1 Plus 2
	0d2 Plus 2 
	0d3 plus 2

Where the numbers following the 'd' indicate the combination number for 
that object.

Set the following flags:  1 and 18. 
Flag 1 is to make the button permanent.
Flag 18 is the no-take property.

When you create the room this lock goes in, be sure to put the buttons as
permanent objects.  Also, be sure to set the exits flags 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
