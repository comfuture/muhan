    Welcome to the DM online manual.  This program was created to
help current and future DMs maintain and run mordor.  This program
is menu driven, so just select the letter of the menu option of
interest.  Entering a 'Q' on a menu screen will exit the program.
Entering 'B' will exit a submenu back to the previous menu (provided
you are in a submenu).

While viewing a file:  hitting the space bar will scroll the document
up one line, hitting return will scroll the document up one screen,
and entering 'q' will quit back to a menu.
